## Description

"Make a wish three times"

If you can make a wish three times before the shooting star disappears, your wish will come true.

This Ruby program simulates a shooting star animation in the terminal.
The star moves down the screen while leaving a trail of random characters (' ', '.', '*', '‚ú®'). 
Once the animation reaches the bottom, a final static display appears, followed by a line of mountain ('‚õ∞Ô∏è ') symbols.

### Internals

- Initialization
  - The program defines a lambda function and immediately calls it with (50, 20, 0.1).
- Animation Loop
  - Clears the screen.
  - Prints a gradually growing star trail using randomly chosen symbols.
  - Moves the üåü downward in each iteration.
  - Sleeps for a short duration to create animation effect.
- Final Static Display
  - Clears the screen.
  - Prints a full screen of trailing characters.
  - Prints a row of ‚õ∞Ô∏è at the bottom to end the animation.
